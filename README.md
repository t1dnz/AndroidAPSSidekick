# AndroidAPS Sidekick

This app is designed to show blood glucose level (BGL) readings from AndroidAPS as a unsleeping display, so at a glance at your smartphone screen you can see what the current glucose level is.

### Why
I want a big, simple display of his numbers and recent treatments in order to get a quick glance if something needs doing.
Options like nightguard are fine, but I would like to have them be a little simplier with things like minutes since...

#### Fixes/required features for 0.1.0
Better erroring when things go wrong (wrong password, no server, no internet...)
Change of units actually doing something (including changing decimal points in UI)
Show logs/report logs in the app (maybe firebase?)
Publish and properly sign the application
get an app icon


#### Other features
highlight peaking and onsetting insulin
add upcoming insulin (like next 20mins of insulin)
Clickable Graph for BGL/basal changes
Last time data was recieved from Nightscout (checking that it is actually working or the other end is broken)
slide left on stats info, current/daily stats 
child lock for settings in the app

#### Replacement of xdrip as side car
send to dexcom share BGLs
Dexcom follow UI to manage sharers
local alerts and notifications
send to nightscout 

#### Really in the furture
Autotune ISF/CSF... and autotune the peaks and onsets of insulin
Suggestions based on learning
